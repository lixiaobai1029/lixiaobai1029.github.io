## 1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 The gas turbine engine is essentially a heat engine using air as a working fluid to provide thrust. To achieve this, the air passing through the engine has to be accelerated; this means that the velocity or kinetic energy of the air is increased. To obtain this increase, the pressure energy is first of all increased, followed by the addition of heat energy, before final conversion back to kinetic Energy in the form of a high velocity jet efflux.
## 2 WORKING CYCLE

1.2 The working cycle of the gas turbine engine is similar to that of the four-stroke piston engine. However, in the gas turbine engine, combustion occurs at a constant pressure, whereas in the piston engine it occurs at a constant volume. Both engine cycles (fig. 2-1) show that in each instance there is induction, compression, combustion and exhaust. These processes are intermittent in the case of the piston engine whilst they occur continuously in the gas turbine. In the piston engine only one stroke is utilized in the production of power, the others being involved in the charging, compressing and exhausting of the working fluid. In contrast, the turbine engine eliminates the three 'idle' strokes, thus enabling more fuel to be burnt in a shorter time; hence it produces a greater power output for a given size of engine.

1.3 Due to the continuous action of the turbine engine and the fact that the combustion chamber is not an enclosed space, the pressure of the air does not rise, like that of the piston engine, during combustion but its volume does increase. This process is known as heating at constant pressure. Under these conditions there are no peak or fluctuating pressures to be withstood, as is the case with the piston engine with its peak pressures in excess of 1,000 lb. per sq. in. It is these peak pressures which make it necessary for the piston engine to employ cylinders of heavy construction and to use high octane fuels, in contrast to the low octane fuels and the light fabricated combustion chambers used on the turbine engine.

1.4 The working cycle upon which the gas turbine engine functions is, in its simplest form, represented by the cycle shown on the pressure volume diagram in fig. 2-2. Point A represents air at atmospheric pressure that is compressed along the line AB. From B to C heat is added to the air by introducing and burning fuel at constant pressure, thereby consider-ably increasing the volume of air. Pressure losses in the combustion chambers (Part 4) are indicated by the drop between B and C. From C to D the gases resulting from combustion expand through the turbine and jet pipe back to atmosphere. During this part of the cycle, some of the energy in the expanding gases is turned into mechanical power by the turbine; the remainder, on its discharge to atmosphere, provides a propulsive jet.

1.5 Because the turbo-jet engine is a heat engine, the higher the temperature of combustion the greater is the expansion of the gases. The combustion temperature, however, must not exceed a value that gives a turbine gas entry temperature suitable for the design and materials of the turbine assembly.

1.6 The use of air-cooled blades in the turbine assembly permits a higher gas temperature and a consequently higher thermal efficiency.
## 3 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN PRESSURE, VOLUME AND TEMPERATURE

1.7 During the working cycle of the turbine engine, the airflow or 'working fluid' receives and gives up heat, so producing changes in its pressure, volume and temperature. These changes as they occur are closely related, for they follow a common principle that is embodied in a combination of the laws of Boyle and Charles. Briefly, this means that the product of the pressure and the volume of the air at the various stages in the working cycle is proportion-al to the absolute temperature of the air at those stages. This relationship applies for whatever means are used to change the state of the air. For example, whether energy is added by combustion or by compression, or is extracted by the turbine, the heat change is directly proportional to the work added or taken from the gas.

1.8 There are three main conditions in the engine working cycle during which these changes occur. During compression, when work is done to increase the pressure and decrease the volume of the air, there is a corresponding rise in the temperature. During combustion, when fuel is added to the air and burnt to increase the temperature, there is a corre-sponding increase in volume whilst the pressure remains almost constant. During expansion, when work is taken from the gas stream by the turbine assembly, there is a decrease in temperature and pressure with a corresponding increase in volume.

1.9 Changes in the temperature and pressure of the air can be traced through an engine by using the airflow diagram in fig. 2-5. With the airflow being continuous, volume changes are shown up as changes in velocity.

1.10 The efficiency with which these changes are made will determine to what extent the desired relations between the pressure, volume and temperature are attained. For the more efficient the compressor, the higher the pressure generated for a given work input; that is, for a given temperature rise of the air. Conversely, the more efficiently the turbine uses the expanding gas, the greater the output of work for a given pressure drop in the gas.

1.11	When the air is compressed or expanded at 100 per cent efficiency, the process is said to be adiabatic. Since such a change means there is no energy losses in the process, either by friction, conduction or turbulence, it is obviously impossible to achieve in practice; 90 per cent is a good adiabatic efficiency for the compressor and turbine.
## 3 CHANGES IN VELOCITY AND PRESSURE

1.12 During the passage of the air through the engine, aerodynamic and energy requirements demand changes in its velocity and pressure. For instance: during compression, a rise in the pressure of the air is required and not an increase in its velocity. After the air has been heated and its internal energy increased by combustion, an increase in the velocity of the gases is necessary to force the turbine to rotate. At the propelling nozzle a high exit velocity is required, for it is the change in the momentum of the air that provides the thrust on the aircraft. Local decelerations of airflow are also required, as for instance, in the combustion chambers to provide a low velocity zone for the flame to burn.

1.13 These various changes are effected by means of the size and shape of the ducts through which the air passes on its way through the engine. Where a conversion from velocity (kinetic) energy to pressure is required, the passages are divergent in shape. Conversely, where it is required to convert the energy stored in the combustion gases to velocity energy, a convergent passage or nozzle (fig. 2-3) is used. These shapes apply to the gas turbine engine where the airflow velocity is subsonic or sonic, i.e. at the local speed of sound. Where supersonic speeds are encountered, such as in the propelling nozzle of the rocket, athodyd and some jet engines (Part 6), a convergent-divergent nozzle or venturi (fig. 2-4) is used to obtain the maximum conversion of the energy in the combustion gases to kinetic energy.

1.14 The design of the passages and nozzles is of great importance, for upon their good design will depend the efficiency with which the energy changes are effected. Any interference with the smooth airflow creates a loss in efficiency and could result in component failure due to vibration caused by eddies or turbulence of the airflow.

1.15 The path of the air through a gas turbine engine varies according to the design of the engine. A straight-through flow system (fig. 2-5) is the basic design, as it provides for an engine with a relatively small frontal area and is also suitable for use of the by-pass principle. In contrast, the reverse flow system gives an engine with greater frontal area, but with a reduced overall length. The operation, however, of all engines is similar. The variations due to the different designs are described in the subsequent paragraphs.

1.16	The major difference of a turbo-propeller engine is the conversion of gas energy into mechanical power to drive the propeller. Only a small amount of 'jet thrust' is available from the exhaust system. The majority of the energy in the gas stream is absorbed by additional turbine stages, which drive the propeller through internal shafts (Part 5).

1.17	As can be seen in fig. 2-5, the by-pass principle involves a division of the airflow. Conventionally, all the air taken in is given an initial low compression and a percentage is then ducted to by-pass, the remainder being delivered to the combustion system in the usual manner. As described in Part 21, this principle is conducive to improved propulsive efficiency and specific fuel consumption.

1.18	An important design feature of the by-pass engine is the by-pass ratio; that is, the ratio of cool air by-passed through the duct to the flow of air passed through the high pressure system. With low by-pass ratios, i.e. in the order of 1:1, the two streams are usually mixed before being exhausted from the engine. The fan engine may be regarded as an extension of the by-pass principle, and the requirement for high by-pass ratios of up to 5:1 is largely met by using the front fan in a twin or triple-spool configuration (on which the fan is, in fact, the low pressure compressor) both with and without mixing of the airflows. Very high by-pass ratios, in the order of 15:1, are achieved using propfans. These are a variation on the turbo-propeller theme but with advanced technology propellers capable of operating with high efficiency at high aircraft speeds.

1.19	On some front fan engines, the by-pass airstream is ducted overboard either directly behind the fan through short ducts or at the rear of the engine through longer ducts; hence the term 'ducted fan'. Another, though seldom used, variation is that of the aft fan.
